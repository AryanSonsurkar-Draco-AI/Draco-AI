Basics: Variables (snake_case), types (int, float, str, bool), and f-strings for formatting.
Control: if/elif/else; loops (for ... in, while) and enumerate/range for indices.
Functions: def name(args): return value. Use docstrings and type hints when possible.
Collections: list/tuple/set/dict. List comprehensions for concise transformations.
Errors: try/except/else/finally; read the traceback to find the line and exception type.
Modules: import standard libraries (math, os, json). Use venv and requirements.txt for deps.
OOP: class, __init__, self, methods; dataclasses for simple containers.
Testing: write small tests; print or use assert; isolate tricky parts.
